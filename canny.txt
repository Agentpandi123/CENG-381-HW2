The program canny.c processes images in PGM format by following a series of steps. First, it smooths the image using a Gaussian filter to reduce noise. Then, it calculates the first derivative of the image in both x and y directions to detect intensity gradients. The magnitude of these gradients is computed, followed by non-maximum suppression to thin out the edges. Finally, hysteresis thresholding is applied to identify strong and weak edges based on user-defined thresholds. The code outputs the detected edges as a PGM image. The main function coordinates reading the input image, calling the edge detection process, and writing the output image. Additionally, functions for Gaussian smoothing, derivative computation, and thresholding are included to handle the edge detection process comprehensively.
